# Predicting-Canadian-Overnight-Interest-Rate
# In this code I try to predict Canadian Overnight Interest Rates using Supervised Prediction methods
# Linear and multi-linear regression models were utilized and the methods used were best subset selection, Ridge Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Method. 
# After the feedback from my professor, I will attempt to use non-linear regression model, and use different methods like Lasso, stepwise backward and forward selection, elastic nets, Principal component analysis, and regression trees in addition to the previous methods used. I will also attempt to use neural network method.
